This directory contains the source code for the AppEngine aggregator
software.  The world-accessible interface is contained within the views.py
file.  The data store model is stored in model.py.  Interaction with the
data store is mostly contained within the controller.py file.  Default
templates are stored in templates/, the implementation of the geomodel is
contained in the geomodel/ directory, and frontend helper files are in the
