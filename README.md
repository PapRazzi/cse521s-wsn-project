This project is for the CSE 521S: Wireless Sensor Networks class.  It is
designed to implement a parking guidance and information system with TinyOS.
The goal is to enable distinct hardware sensors to interact with a Tmote
Sky/TelosB node, the node is then connected to a mesh network that sends
updates to a base station, and the base station interacts with a display
service to present the information to end users.

The basic directory structure is as follows:

* README.md - this file!
* doc - all documents/presentations generated for this project
* src - source code for this project
  * frontend - front-end code for displaying the status to end users
