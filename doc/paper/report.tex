\begin{abstract}
About 2 paragraphs for describing what this paper is about.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

More details text about what this is about, what exists, why we wanted to
do this (why it was interesting/motivation, etc.).

What the rest of the paper has in store.

\section{Goals}\label{sec:goals}

What are the goals for this project, what we set out to do (in detail).

\section{Design}\label{sec:design}

Design and components of the infrastructure.  What we need to succeed in
out goals.
High level description of the various components we developed, to be
explained in detail below.
Probably a graphics of the gist of the system.

\subsection{Hardware}

This should cover the physical hardware we used in building this.
Including (but not limited to):

- TelosB motes (listing any relevant specifications, why we used TelosB
 and not something else) \cite{xbow:telosb-datasheet}.

- External sensor we used, specifications for that, more detail than
 TelosB since the reader will be less familiar with it, why we used that.

At least one pictures of the telosb, the sensors, or the telosb with sensor
attached.

\subsection{Software}

Yup we had software.

A paragraph or two about TinyOS and building whatever we used there
(interfaces, interaction with other sensors and base
station, CTP)~\cite{tep119:collection}.

A paragraph about the base station software and what it does.

A paragraph laying out what Google AppEngine is, why we chose it, and what
it does for us.

A paragraph or two describing the AE backend and frontend(s).

\section{Implementation}

More detailed description of the underlying implementation (packet formats
in the network, sending data to AppEngine, specific technology used on
backend, any frontend stuff).


\section{Experiment}\label{sec:experiment}

Paragraph about experiments that show our system works.

\section{Related Works}\label{sec:related}

\section{Lessons Learned}\label{sec:lessons}

Anything we would have done differently if we were to pursue this project
in more detail again.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

Conclusions from this project.
